The U.S.A. obesity prevalence was 41.9% in 2017 â€“ March 2020 according to https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/106273

I think this country has a partiuclar issue with obesity and here is my hot take as to why that is.

A combination of both poor nutrition and more sedintary jobs.

I personally find that people who work more phsyically demanding jobs tend to not have trouble with obeisity, I think this is primarily due to the fact that they exercise their body throughout the day.

Someone like me who works on a computer all day and sits in a comfy chair probably isn't demanding nearly as much energy from my muscles.

Here is my theory... I think the people of the U.S.A. are leaning towards extremes. Extreme obesity, and extreme fitness.
 
Allow me to explain.

Gyms are more popular nowadays than ever before. It has only been the last 70 or so years people have really started to augment their fitness by other means. for example jogging didn't even become popular until the 1960s.

For the population becoming more sedintary they are also gaining more weight, and depending on their diet it could become a viscious cycle and boom, obesity.

For the population who are becoming more sedintary but realizing they need to do something about their health, they have a plan, and that plan is... the gym.

Being at the gym to counter the affects of a more sedintary job doesn't just counter the job itself, but it impacts the individual's fitness to a much higher degree than if they were simply working a more physically demanding job.

What I mean by this is that a gym, and specifically weight training, targets specific muscles that would not normally be exposed to such demand.

As someone gets stronger, weights get heavier, and now suddenly you are developing a phsyic that is more extreme.

Not going to the gym and sitting at home and drinking soda ( high fructose corn syrup ) will have the exact opposite effect, you will become obese.

So in conclusion, the transition to more desk jobs and less manual labor is creating a larger divide in this country in terms of physical health.
